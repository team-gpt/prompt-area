# Contributing to Prompt Area

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Development Setup

```bash
pnpm install          # Install dependencies (pnpm required)
pnpm dev              # Start dev server (Next.js + Turbopack)
```

> **Note:** This project enforces pnpm. Running `npm install` or `yarn install` will fail.

## Making Changes

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes in the `registry/new-york/blocks/` directory for component code
3. Add or update tests in `__tests__/` directories alongside the code you changed
4. Run the checks below before submitting

## Code Quality

Before submitting a pull request, make sure all checks pass:

```bash
pnpm lint             # Lint with ESLint
pnpm typecheck        # Type-check with TypeScript
pnpm test             # Run tests with Vitest
pnpm build            # Verify production build
```

A pre-commit hook (via Lefthook) will automatically lint and format staged files.

## Code Style

- Code is formatted with Prettier — run `pnpm format` to auto-fix
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript strict mode — no `any` types without justification
- Keep the zero-dependency philosophy for the core component

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Write a clear description of what changed and why
- Include before/after screenshots for visual changes
- Make sure CI passes before requesting review

## Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or request features
- Include a minimal reproduction when reporting bugs
- Check existing issues before creating a new one
